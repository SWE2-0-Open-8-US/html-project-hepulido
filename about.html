                        Hello, my name is Hector and I'm a Jr software engineer.
                        I've developed a strong foundation in programming and an
                        aptitude for learning new technologies.<br>
                        As a software developer, I am passionate about learning and
                        developing new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the
                        latest trends in tech industry, experimenting with new
                        programming languages and tools, and contributing to open source
                        projects.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-secc-2">
                    <p>
                        One of my favorite hobbies is hiking. I love spending time
                        outdoors, immersing myself in nature, and challenging myself
                        physically. I enjoy discovering new trails and experiencing the
                        beauty of different landscapes. Hiking is not only a great way for
                        me to stay fit, but it also helps me clear my mind and recharge my
                        batteries. </p>

                    <p class="par-3">
                        Finally, I cherish spending time with my family and friends. I
                        love to catch up with loved ones over a home-cooked meal, go on
                        weekend trips together, and engage in meaningful conversations. I
                        value the time I spend with the people I care about and make an
                        effort to prioritize those relationships in my life.

                <p class="par-4">
                    Overall, I am a well-rounded individual who enjoy a variety of
                    hobbies and interests. From software development to hiking to
                    spending time with loved ones, I am always looking for ways to grow,
                    learn, and make the most of my time.
